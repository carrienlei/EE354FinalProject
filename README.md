Background: 
Being students who love spending our time in nature -- especially in the ocean -- we wanted to create a game that combined our skills in electrical engineering and our passions beyond academia. The objective is for the diver to collect all the plastic pieces while avoiding dangerous encounters, ultimately bringing to light the importance of keeping our waters plastic-free and safe for marine habitation.
